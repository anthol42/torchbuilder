# Experiment 1

## Description
The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of deep neural networks.
We are going to train a simple model using CNN layers found as example on the official pytorch website.
We are going to train this model on the MNIST dataset.

## Hypothesis
Results won't be that good since the model is quite inefficiently built.  In fact, it uses really few CNN parameters, 
and a lot in dense layers.  In addition, it uses two layers of dropout one after the other which is useless.

## Results
