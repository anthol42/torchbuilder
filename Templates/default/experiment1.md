# Experiment 1

## Description
The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of deep neural networks.
We are going to train a simple model using CNN layers and linear layers.

## Hypothesis
Since we are training and evaluating on the MNIST dataset, we expect results above 99% of accuracy since it is an easy 
dataset.
